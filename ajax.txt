What is AJAX?

1 AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
2 AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.
3 AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

  1  Update a web page without reloading the page
  2  Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
  3  Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
  4  Send data to a server - in the background
